          <p class="p-highlight">Between the months of December and April, you will likely hear the songs of Humbpack Whale while snorkeling, and may even run into pods of dolphins and whales on your way out to the crater. It is better to go when winds are calm as water clarity is better and there is less current.

          <h3 class="location-sub travel-tip">Travel Tips:</h3>
          <p class="tip">Sunscreen is a must, but please be sure to use Sunscreen that is <a href="" class="plink">reef safe</a>.
