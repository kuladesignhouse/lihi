      Just off the shores of Makena sits the 23 acre crescent shaped volcanic
      crater, Molokini. With over 250 species of fish and some of the most clear
      waters in the state of Hawaii, Molokini is one of Hawaii's top diving
      destinations. It is estimated Molokini is about 230,000 years old, and
      over the course of the past 1500 years, Molokini has gone from Ancient
      Hawaiian fishing grounds, to target practice for World War II bombers, but
      in 1977 it was established as a Marine Life Conservation District. This
      designation has allowed the marine life here to flourish.

      In the midst of the deep waters surrounding it, this reef oasis attracts
      fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, mammals and more. Dolphins, monk seals,
      Whale Sharks and even great white sharks have been cited at Molokini, an
      indicator of the high biodiversity that congregates to this offshore
      crater.

      Although Sharks frequent the island, they are often shy or docile, making
      for such encounters being an exciting event rather than a frightening one,
      for those lucky enough to experience them. Above the water numerous
      seabirds nest on Molokini, a respite from long days at sea, and a good
      vantage point for opportunities to feed that may present themselves near
      the island.

      A number of boats take tourists to and from Molokini daily, usually
      departing from Maalaea Harbor. Kayak tours are also available but can be
      fairly arduous, so being physically fit is a must.

      Between the months of December and April, you will likely hear the songs
      of Humbpack Whale while snorkeling, and may even run into pods of dolphins
      and whales on your way out to the crater. It is better to go when winds
      are calm as water clarity is better and there is less current. For more
      information on current and forecasted weather check our # weather page.
    travel-tips:
      - content-tip: >-
          Sunscreen is a must, but please be sure to use Sunscreen that is <a
          href="" class="plink">reef safe</a>. Hawaii is soon to pass a bill
          requiring sunscreens to be reef safe, but until then it is important
          especially at locations like Molokini to do what one can to protect
          these fragile environments.
      - content-tip: >-
          Bring an underwater camera, and purchase Melatonin or nausea wrist
          bands if prone to seasickness.
