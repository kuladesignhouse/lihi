          <p>Just off the shores of Makena sits the 23 acre crescent shaped volcanic crater, Molokini. With over 250 species of fish and some of the most clear waters in the state of Hawaii, Molokini is one of Hawaii's top diving destinations. It is estimated Molokini is about 230,000 years old, and over the course of the past 1500 years, Molokini has gone from Ancient Hawaiian fishing grounds, to target practice for World War II bombers, but in 1977 it was established as a Marine Life Conservation District. This designation has allowed the marine life here to flourish.</p>

                <p>A Hawkfish uses this similar looking coral to hide among the reef. Molokini offers a rare opportunity to see these and other scarsely seen fish such as this.</p>

          <p>In the midst of the deep waters surrounding it, this reef oasis attracts fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, mammals and more. Dolphins, monk seals, Whale Sharks and even great white sharks have been cited at Molokini, an indicator of the high biodiversity that congregates to this offshore crater.</p>
          <p>Although Sharks frequent the island, they are often shy or docile, making for such encounters being an exciting event rather than a frightening one, for those lucky enough to experience them. Above the water numerous seabirds nest on Molokini, a respite from long days at sea, and a good vantage point for opportunities to feed that may present themselves near the island.</p>

            <p class="p-highlight">Between the months of December and April, you will likely hear the songs of Humbpack Whale while snorkeling, and may even run into pods of dolphins and whales on your way out to the crater. It is better to go when winds are calm as water clarity is better and there is less current.

            <h3 class="location-sub travel-tip">Travel Tips:</h3>
            <p class="tip">Sunscreen is a must, but please be sure to use Sunscreen that is <a href="" class="plink">reef safe</a>. Hawaii is soon to pass a bill requiring sunscreens to be reef safe, but until then it is important especially at locations like Molokini to do what one can to protect these fragile environments.</p>
            <p class="tip">Bring an underwater camera, and purchase Melatonin or nausea wrist bands if prone to seasickness.</p>
